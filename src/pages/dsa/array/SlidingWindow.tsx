          ðŸšª Sliding Window Technique
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4">
          The <strong>Sliding Window</strong> technique is a powerful strategy used to reduce time complexity for problems that involve arrays or strings. It involves creating a window which can either be fixed or variable in size and sliding it across the array to compute results dynamically.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">ðŸ§  Key Concept</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          By maintaining a window and updating the result as the window slides, we avoid recalculating results from scratch each time. This often brings time complexity down from <code>O(nÂ²)</code> to <code>O(n)</code>.
